Disney abandoned Slack following unfinished project data leak, and China urged vigilance against Taiwanese cyberattacks. TfL, the London transport authority, has restricted some customer data access amid an ongoing cyber attack. Consumer tech news included Russian cyber-influence operations targeting the Harris\u2013Walz campaign, Apple raising prices for battery replacements, and more. A gang of computer engineers defrauded SGPGI's neurologist Dr. Ruchika of Rs 2.8 crore. TfL's cyber attack has raised questions about passenger data and its security."}
