A major cyber attack on the UK's Transport for London (TfL) has resulted in slow-burning and potentially costly fallout. CREST is working to boost global cyber capacity in 10 emerging economies, including Thailand and the Philippines. UK firms are overconfident about paying ransoms to cyber criminals. China is urging vigilance against Taiwanese cyberattacks. The global cyber weapons market is expected to reach USD 23.7 billion by 2031. Cyber insurance is becoming increasingly important for businesses to mitigate their risk. A major cyber breach at TfL has restricted access to customer data."}
