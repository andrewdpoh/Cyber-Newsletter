Cyber insurance, although evolving to address new threats, may not always cover all the risks. Companies must take steps to mitigate vulnerabilities, particularly as attackers target critical sectors like healthcare, and the market for offensive cyber operations is expanding. It is becoming increasingly important for businesses to implement robust cybersecurity measures and stay informed about emerging threats. In addition to these, we also see a concerning trend of cyberweapons market development and the emergence of new AI-powered finance apps that might be vulnerable to attacks. These developments are crucial for Singaporean nonprofits to stay aware of and take necessary precautions."}
